# Zero-Player-Game
Small 0PG to play around with basic AI in an OOP setting

-Big current issue, I have a lot of duplicate functionality.  Positions are recorded inside the object, but also in a big ArrayList in BoardBuilder, for example.  The design is not clean, or logical.  It needs to be planned out and rewritten, no amount of cleaning will suffice.  It may work this way, but it will never be good code.
